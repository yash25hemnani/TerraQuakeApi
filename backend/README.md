## Overview

TerraQuake is a comprehensive seismic data platform that combines a powerful REST API with an intuitive web interface. It provides researchers, developers, and organizations with easy access to real-time earthquake data, advanced filtering capabilities, and interactive visualizations.

---

## Project Overview

- **Backend (TerraQuake API)** — Node.js + Express REST API to serve earthquake data.
- **Frontend** — React + TailwindCSS interface for visualizing seismic events.
- **Data Source** — INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) and synthetic demo data.
- **API Access** — Public endpoints for querying earthquakes by time, magnitude, location, and more.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB** (planned for persistent data)
- **JWT** (for secure access, future feature)
- **Custom earthquake generator** (for demo/testing)

### Frontend

- **React 19**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **React Router**
- **Hero sections, maps, charts** (via Leaflet, Chart.js – if added)

## API Features
## 🌍 Earthquake API — Endpoints Overview

All endpoints support **pagination**:  
- `page` *(optional, default: 1)* → Page number  
- `limit` *(optional, default: 50)* → Number of results per page  

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Query Parameters |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| GET | `/v1/earthquakes/recent` | Fetches recent earthquakes from the beginning of the year to today, sorted from most recent to least recent. | `page`, `limit` |

## 🗺️ Map & GeoJSON API — Endpoints Overview

⚠️ **Note:** These endpoints are currently **not yet available** (coming soon).

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Query / Path Parameters |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| GET | `/v1/earthquakes/markers` | Returns **map-ready coordinates of earthquakes** in GeoJSON format, including location, magnitude, and depth. Optimized for mapping libraries like **Leaflet** or **Mapbox**. | – |
| GET | `/v1/earthquakes/geojson` | Retrieves **all earthquakes** in **GeoJSON format**, enabling integration with geographic visualization tools. | – |
| GET | `/v1/earthquakes/cluster` | Provides **clustered earthquake data** for efficient rendering on maps, reducing visual clutter on large datasets. | – |
